# C++ Calculator Project

This is a simple command-line calculator built using C++ that performs various arithmetic operations. The program allows the user to choose different mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, power, and factorial. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the calculator and perform calculations step-by-step.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds multiple numbers entered by the user.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts two numbers.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides two numbers (with zero division handling).
- **Modulus**: Finds the modulus of two numbers (with zero modulus handling).
- **Power**: Calculates the power of a number with an exponent.
- **Factorial**: Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- IDE or text editor to modify and run the C++ code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or any C++ IDE)

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler.
    - For example, using g++: `g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator`
3. Run the compiled program.
    - On Windows: `./calculator.exe`
    - On Linux/Mac: `./calculator`
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform different calculations.
    - Enter the corresponding symbol for the operation you want to perform.
    - Enter the required numbers for the operation.
5. After performing a calculation, you will have the option to either perform more calculations or exit the program.
